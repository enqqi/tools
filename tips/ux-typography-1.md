## Line Heigths

- The larger the text, the smaller the line height.
- For headings 1.1 to 1.3 the size of the heading
- For the body 1.3 to 1.5 the size of the body text

## Letter spacing

- Heading should have neative letter spacing.
- For headings -1% to -2% the size of the heading go lower if possible.
- For the body ??

## Text align

- Either both centerd or both left, to not combine

## Text width (lines of text)

- Users avoid to read the text the longer it is.
- 600px max for large screens
- Optimal line length for body text is 50-75 characters

## Hirearchy

- Use only 2 font sizes and use colors or weights instead of different sizes

## Spacing

- Keep headings and their body text visually linked by using a 1:2 spacing rule
- Since the bottom heading and the body text has a closer relationship, they should also be positioned closer to each other.
- we use a multiplier:
  - if the distance between the bottom heading and the bottom body is `1x (16px)`
  - the distance between the bottom heading and the top body should be `2x (32px)`

- Golden Ratio: text size * 1.618 for line height
